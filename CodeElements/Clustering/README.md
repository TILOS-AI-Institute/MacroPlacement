# Placement-guided hypergraph clustering (soft macro definition)
**Placement-guided hypergraph clustering (soft macro defintion)**
cluster millions of standard cells into a few thousand clusters.
It takes synthesized netlist and def file with placed IO pins as input, 
then generates clustered netlist (in lef/def format) using hMETIS (1998 binary). 
In default mode, it will also run RePlAce in GUI mode automatically to place 
the clustered netlist. We implement the flow based on  **OpenROAD APIs**. **MAKE LINKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!**
Please refer to **the OpenROAD repo** for explanation of each Tcl command.  
We have provided the openroad exe in the [**utils**](./utils/) dir.

Input file: setup.tcl  (you can follow the example to set up your own design)

Output_files:  clusters.lef  and clustered_netlist.def

Example commands:  python generate_clustered_netlist.py ariane hmetis

You can use command:  python generate_clustered_netlist.py -h for other options


Note:  In this example, we use the ariane design implemented in NanGate45.
The netlist is synthesized by Yosys, and the floorplan def is generated by
OpenROAD.
