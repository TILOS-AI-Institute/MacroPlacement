# NanGate45 (FreePDK45, 45nm Open Cell Library, bsg_FakeRAM memory generation)

The NanGate45 Open Cell Library is available under an Apache2.0 license from ...

It is based on FreePDK45, available at ...

As the FreePDK45/NanGate45 enablement does not have memory generators, we use the bsg_FakeRAM memory generator that is available at ...

With this combined enablement, testcases with SRAMs can be synthesized, placed and routed using both proprietary (commercial) tools such as Cadence Genus/Innovus, and open-source tools such as OpenROAD.
