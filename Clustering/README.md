### Clustering Flow devloped by Zhiang, May, 2022
### It takes synthesized netlist and def file with
### placed IO pins as input, then generate clustered
### netlist (in lef/def format) by hemtis. In the default mode,
### it will also run RePlace in GUI mode automatically
### to place the clustered netlist.
### We implement the flow based on OpenROAD API.
### You can refer to OpenROAD repo for explanation of each tcl
### command.  We have provided the openroad exe in utils dir.

The input file: setup.tcl  (You can follow the example to setup your own design)

The output_files:  clusters.lef  and clustered_netlist.def

Example commands:  python generate_clusterd_netlist.py ariane hmetis

You can use command:  python generate_clusterd_netlist.py -h for other options


Note:  In this example, we use ariane design implemented in Nangate45.
The netlist are synthesized by Yosys. The floorplan def is also generated by
OpenROAD.
