# Netlist preparation of Ariane 133-macro version

sram.sv available in the *./rtl/* directory already contains these changes (16bit configuration). We used this .sv files for our synthesis run and the synthesized netlist contains 136 16bit memory macros. We also ran with 64bit configuration and in that scenario the synthesized netlist contains 37 64bit memory macros (Not added in this repo). As Yosys does not support System-Verlog files, we use the verilog netlist available in the [ORFS](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/tree/master/flow/designs/src/ariane) GitHub and replace the 64bit memory macros with four or three 16bit memory macros based on the number of connected read-data pins. This modified netlist is available in the *./rtl/sv2v/* directory.
