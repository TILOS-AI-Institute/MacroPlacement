# Netlist preparation of mempool tile 
MemPool tile is part of MemPool which is an open-source many-core system targeting image processing applications. It implements 256 RISC-V cores that can access a large, shared L1 memory in at most five cycles. We downloaded the netlist from the [mempool](https://github.com/pulp-platform/mempool) GitHub repository. All the required SystemVerilog files are copied into the *./rtl* directory.
